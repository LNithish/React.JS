React is component driven development.
React uses declarative extension to the javascript language called JSX.
React uses clever architectural design known as virtual DOM.
Uses Babel compiler to convert JSX to pure JavaScript.

React build by facebook. used to build components based user interface.
These component have their own life cycle and state.
simple components comes together to make more complex components/UI.
helps in building reusable, stateful and interactive components easily and easy to maintain.
components should be well designed and should have single responsibility.

REACT FEATURES:
Encapsulated components manage their own states. Doesnt need to worry about internal state of other components.
extreme performance.
Generally DOM updates and rerendering are what makes slow. React Doesnt directly interact with DOM of the browser.
Instead React under the hood has virtual representation of DOM. Which is then reconciled with the actual DOM.
These reconciliation process ensures that only those DOM nodes that have actually changed are re-rendered or updated in actual DOM.
The process where the virtual DOM is compared with actual DOM to see whether any changes have to be applied to actual DOM is called reconciliation process.
This virtual DOM is a in memory copy of the DOM that your browser displays.
server side rendering is supported using node and simply display the static page in the site. Virtual DOM helps in enable this.
communication within react application follows very strict direction of flow of data. 
communication using one way data flow. Data flows from top level compoenet to low level component.
React will re-render or change the component based on the state of the data
code is predictable, robust, and easy to debug.

JSX:
React.CreateElement and ReactDOM.Render is tedious to use.
That is why you'll use an HTML like syntax to define your HTML content, it is called JSX.
JSX stands for Javascript syntax extension. 
With JSX you can define user define tags/HTML lile elements. It is user defined compoenets.
JSX allows you to write HTML code inside the JavaScript.

BABEL COMPILER:
It converts JSX into pure Javascript which browser can understand.
during development it converts on the fly.
during production need to precompile for avoiding performance impact.
A function can return both javascript data types and also a React.JSX.elements

PROPS and STATE:
There are two ways to pass data to React component.(props and state)
Props refers to the data that you pass in from the rest of the application toa component so that the component can use that data to display itself.
State is data that is internal to a component.
PROPS are initialization data passed from parent compoenet to child compoenet.
props are considered to be read-only.The data that is present within props should not be changed by the component.
To pass default props we can use defaultProps attribute like classname.defaultProps={Props details}.
propTypes is an attribute in class component to define the type of prop.
There is a specific prop called children passed automatically within this.prop.children, No need to pass any value for this prop.
children prop allows the component to access the child elements of that compoenet.

Every React component is actually a state machine and has internal state held within itself.
This is private data that is internal to the component.Components which hold state are called stateful components.
Data that is private or internal to a component is stored in the state of a component.
This is not data that is passed in from outside,this is data that belongs to a component
state should never be modified directly,otherwise component re-rendering will not occur and your components
State is stored in a special property called state which is accessible within the constructor using this.state.
Each time you update the state component will re render automatically by the react library.

Higher level components should calculate and manage state.And they should pass down data to lower level components using props.
Components have to be re-rendered if their props change or their state change.
