React is component driven development.
React uses declarative extension to the javascript language called JSX.
React uses clever architectural design known as virtual DOM.
Uses Babel compiler to convert JSX to pure JavaScript.

React build by facebook. used to build components based user interface.
These component have their own life cycle and state.
simple components comes together to make more complex components/UI.
helps in building reusable, stateful and interactive components easily and easy to maintain.
components should be well designed and should have single responsibility.

REACT FEATURES:
Encapsulated components manage their own states. Doesnt need to worry about internal state of other components.
extreme performance.
Generally DOM updates and rerendering are what makes slow. React Doesnt directly interact with DOM of the browser.
Instead React under the hood has virtual representation of DOM. Which is then reconciled with the actual DOM.
These reconciliation process ensures that only those DOM nodes that have actually changed are re-rendered or updated in actual DOM.
The process where the virtual DOM is compared with actual DOM to see whether any changes have to be applied to actual DOM is called reconciliation process.
This virtual DOM is a in memory copy of the DOM that your browser displays.
server side rendering is supported using node and simply display the static page in the site. Virtual DOM helps in enable this.
communication within react application follows very strict direction of flow of data. 
communication using one way data flow. Data flows from top level compoenet to low level component.
React will re-render or change the component based on the state of the data
code is predictable, robust, and easy to debug.
